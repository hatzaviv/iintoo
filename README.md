## Instructions

1. Clone the repository into your apache directory so you can run the php files

2. Create and populate the database:
    1. Run iintoo.sql e.g. mysql -u root -p < iintoo.sql
    2. Populate the database from products.sql e.g mysql -u root -p iintoo < products.sql

3. Open your browser and navigate to where you run PHP and the directory you put the project in for me it's localhost/iintoo

4. Check the test:
    1. Notes:

        * Outside of the test I would add more functions like edit/ delete etc
    2. Browse the products
